I was practicing the use of Kepler’s third law formula T^2 / R^3 in Grade 11 physics (physics 20 where I’m from) to find the period of Mars’ orbit when the known values in the question are: Period of Earth(365 days), Orbital radius (1 AU) and it said that the orbital radius of Mars was 1.52 times larger than Earth’s orbital radius. I had no trouble finding the period of Mars, which in my workbook the answer was 684 days, which is what I calculated, but it was all using approximations so I knew that it was close enough for gr 11 calculations. But what made me confused was that by accident I had used the radius of Earth (6.371•10^6 m) in my calculation for the R in the formula T^2 / R^3 and kept that Keplers constant I found, I just made this mistake because I was so used to using the radius of Earth in other topics in the unit. Then, when finding the period of Mars, I did the square root of:keplers constant I found •(1.52•(6.371•10^6 m))^3). So even though I used the radius of Earth instead of the orbital radius of Earth, I got the same answer. To be sure that it wasn’t a fluke, I tried the same steps to find the period of Jupiter, and then Uranus, after just searching up the different values that I knew I had to find. For the Jupiter calculation, I calculated a period of 4314.33 Earth days (compared to the true value of 4330.6 earth days) when I used: (5.186666•Earth radius)^3. And for Uranus I calculated 30583.968 Earth days(compared to the true value of 30687 Earth days) when I used: (19.14•Earth radius)^3. I got the values of 5.186666 and 19.14 just by dividing each planet’s orbital radius by earth’s orbital radius as the original question had done and just given me the factor that I had to multiply the orbital radius by. I’m guessing that the difference between my calculations and the true value are due to one of two things. 1. Something to do with the ellipse of the orbits (something we don’t talk about in Grade 11) and the more spherical shape of the planets. 2. It just worked out that way because there was a correlation between the orbital radius and the radius of each planet. Either way, I thought it was interesting that my results were very close to the real answers even when I used Keplers third law wrong. Thanks, hope someone can explain!
